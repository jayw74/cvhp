Redesign for an HVAC company in New York.

This was a website that I came across while looking around on upwork.  Many times if I find a website that needs some love, I will usually bookmark it in my Projects folder and review it later.  After checking on it about a month later, I noticed it was still in the same state and no one had worked on it.  I decided that I would go ahead and build it out in a modern way, and then contact the company and ask if they were interested.  They still have not gotten back to me, so it lives as a nice portfolio piece.
